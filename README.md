# JetsProject

#Overview
-This project take the user to a bat cave where he or she can learn about some of the bat living in our cave. The user can look at all our bats
at once, see what the bat are up to, see who's the fastest and who can fly the farthest. Visitors to our cave can even check-in on two of our special
bats to see how they're doing. Plus if the user needs a place to store their own bat our cave as plenty of space. Want to take your friend home no 
problem check them out at any time or let one of our bats sleep over. And when the user is done with their visit into our cave just let us known and we'll
send you on your way.

#Lessons Learned

Knowledge: Can't replace experience. Just cause I have an understanding of how to do something doesn't mean I know how to do it. After this project
I find I am still that way with objects. I understanding that a object is an collection of non-static fields that represent characteristics and methods
that represent behaviors, but I still find creating them confusing. I'm not sure when I'm creating an instance of one vs making one and a lot more.

Practice: I need more practice with writing code in different ways. I've doing what works and not venturing to far in syntax that makes nervous or 
uncomfortable, for example for each loops. In this project I did my best to only use for each loops to help break the habit of sticky with what I 
know.

Lazy: I think I already become a lazy coder. I've been going back into my old projects and recycling code so I don't type all over again. Especially if
it's something I know I'm going to use in the new project. Not sure if that's good or bad.
